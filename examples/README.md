# Examples 

These examples show NIH research projects where geospatial linkages were used to derive variables used for various purposes in the analyses.

## Personalized Environment and Genes Study
Geospatial linkage was used to add many covariates to the [PEGS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/crb/studies/pegs) study at different time points.
We're currently working on an Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS) based on these data to compare to a prior [survey-based PEGS ExWAS](https://academic.oup.com/exposome/article/4/1/osae002/7606776).

In a recent paper on [immune-mediated disease in PEGS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022006146), we used geospatial data to derive an indicator of exposure and variables used for control of confounding bias.

## Gulf oil spill long-term follow-up study (GuLF)
We used geospatial linkage to the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS) [to understand how natural disasters affect mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00301-z).

## Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementia
This paper used multiple [geospatially-linked measures](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP13183) to explore how neighborhood environments shape ADRD cumulative incidence.

## Metal Exposures
This paper used proximity measures to look at predictors of body metal [measured in toenail clippings](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP11045).
