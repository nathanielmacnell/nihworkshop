# Examples 

These examples show NIH research projects where geospatial linkages were used to derive variables used for various purposes in the analyses.

## NDI
Ian created [the ndi R package](https://github.com/idblr/ndi) to facilitate linkage to the NDI (like the example we used in the workshop). The NDI variables can be useful covariates in many  study designs because they are associated with many different exposures and outcomes (i.e. they're often confounding factors).

## Personalized Environment and Genes Study
Geospatial linkage was used to add many covariates to the [PEGS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/crb/studies/pegs) study at different time points.
We're currently working on an Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS) based on these data to compare to a prior [survey-based PEGS ExWAS](https://academic.oup.com/exposome/article/4/1/osae002/7606776). In a recent paper on [immune-mediated disease in PEGS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022006146), we used geospatial data to derive an indicator of exposure and variables used for control of confounding bias.

## Time to Conceive
We used temporally-specific linkage to assess the relationship between [air pollution and miscarriage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935125012162). 


## Gulf oil spill long-term follow-up study (GuLF)
We used geospatial linkage to help look at how [greenspace and air pollution impact mental health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724045820). We also used geospatial linkages [to understand how natural disasters affect mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00301-z), [how disaster affect cardiovascular disease risk](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969725009714), and [how exposure to solar radiation affects mood disorders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-024-00691-w)

## Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementia
This paper used multiple [geospatially-linked measures](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP13183) to explore how neighborhood environments shape ADRD cumulative incidence.

## Metal Exposures
This paper used proximity measures to look at predictors of body metal [measured in toenail clippings](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP11045).
